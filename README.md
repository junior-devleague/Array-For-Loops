# Array-For-Loops!
You will be learning about how to create arrays, access DOM elements, and use for loops to access the values in the arrays!

## Getting Started
1. **Fork** this respository
2. **Clone** this repo from your personal GitHub account.
3. Only work in the file called `main.js`

#Exercises

##Global variable
Declare a variable named `count` equal to 0

##increaseCount()
You will be creating a function which will increment the count of a number in a div element
1. Create a variable named `countElement` that accesses the _DOM_ element `count`
Hint: What is `count` equal to in the index.html?
2. Assign the `countElement` innerHTML to `count`
3. Increment `count` by one with each click

**ADVANCED**
1. Use a _FOR_ loop to increment `count` by 10
2. Use a _FOR_ loop to decrement `count` by 1

##addColor()
You will be creating a function which will give the attribute _backgroundColor_ to the divs on the _DOM_
1. Create an array named `colors` and set it's value to 3 different colors
2. Create a variable named `documentDIVs` that accesses the all the _DOM_ divs
Hint: You want to access the elements by their tag name
3. Create a _FOR_ loop to iterate through `colors`
4. Within the _FOR_ loop, assign 1 value from `colors` to the second `documentDIVs` backgroundColor
Hint: Use .style.backgroundColor to give the attribute and value to the element _DOM_

**ADVANCED**
1. Can you assign each value in `colors` to each `documentDIVs` using the same _FOR_ loop?
